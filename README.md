In this project, I implemented a simple logic programming interpreter based on a subset of the constructed language Lojban. The program reads a sequence of statements, scans them into tokens, parses them into structured predicates, and evaluates them in a small knowledge base. The scanner recognizes names, short words, predicate words, and numbers according to the assignment rules. The parser builds statements beginning with i and supports the short words lo and se, as well as predefined predicates such as fatci, sumji, vujni, dunli, steni, and steko.

The knowledge base stores facts and rules. The cmavo statement defines new predicates, while fatci declares existence. The interpreter supports variable binding, arithmetic operations, list construction, and simple unification to find matching facts or inferred results. The last statement entered is treated as a query, and the program prints the variable values that satisfy it.

This implementation was written in Python for simplicity and readability. It demonstrates how parsing, logical inference, and variable substitution can work together to model a very small logic programming system, similar in spirit to Prolog.
